                            With the beginning of the second trimester, a subject called project management appeared in our schedule. Long before the start of the second year, we managed to complete an internship in which certain gaps in project management were noticeable. That is why, when choosing this subject, I expected to fill in the missing knowledge and experience in this discipline. In the first week, we were introduced to the subject's syllabus. And also for the first time we got acquainted with the online platform for collaboration Miro. This web application proved to be handy in terms of taking notes and displaying them to all people who had access to a particular page. 
It was with the help of Miro that we later conducted practical lessons The Miro interface allows you to conveniently create notes where in the first lesson we talked about ourselves and our goals for the future, who we want to become and what we want to do in the next 5 years. After getting acquainted with the online platform, we later began to post our work and evaluate the work of others. Also in the first lesson, we got acquainted with all types of tasks, among which were works related to the preparation of our project plan, as well as lecture frames and short memos 

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            As mentioned earlier, one of the works that we have to hand over by the end of the trimester is the preparation of the project management stage, which includes project proposal, initiation, planning and execution. Before starting work, it was necessary to decide which project I would choose for this subject. The choice fell on the thesis. Just with the help of this subject, I will be able to better determine all the stages of development of my thesis. The first task was related to determining why we need this project and what benefits it will bring. The title of our diploma work is “Development of a web a application of the AITU. This work is focused on the automation of all processes of the distribution of the academic schedule among students and teachers. Despite the fact that we live in the dawn of the development of innovative technologies that every day help us to facilitate our daily work, many processes have remained in the use of a certain human factor. And if we are talking about higher education institutions, where such processes as setting up an academic calendar take a lot of time, since it must reach each student and teacher. Therefore, in order to solve such problem, we propose the new system of timetable distribution in the form of web application. Our vision in to increase efficiency by creating online university platform for managing academic timetables, which will lead to decreasing time consumption of creating and sharing timetables by 30% by 1st May 2022. Considering the deadline of our project The whole diploma work will be finished by May 2022. Since the web application should be tested before deploying on university’s server to ensure quality of application that will be used in the future. The first stage will relate with researching and analyzing similar scheduling systems. The part will be finished by 1st January. Then it will be followed by creating design that satisfy all requirements by the 1st March. The last two months will be related with development of web-application itself, which have followed by testing and debugging. Overall project proposal allows us to introduce with curial factors such as budget, stakeholders and timeframes for better understanding of different details of our work.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Going to the next stage of project management, we must draw up a project initiation in which we already consider the requirements in terms of resources as well as the definition of stakeholders. This work will allow us to approve important aspects of our thesis in order to know exactly the directions for studying important topics about our project. By defining business cases, we can understand how important this work is and what role it will have for our university in the future. Moreover, in the initiation stage of the project, the first thing we did was determine which stacks of technologies we would use in the development process. Also in this work, it was described about our team, which includes 4 people, including three student developers and one project manager. Before creating and launching our project we should define the problem and analyze that how we can solve it. By identifying the best approach to satisfy students and university’s staff requirements, because our project after successful completion will be used in the future. Therefore, in order to finish our project, we should clarify all crucial factors which will lead to quality web-application for managing timetables. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Following the next stage of project management, we approach as parts of planning, where important aspects are communication plan, work breakdown structure and stakeholder analysis worksheet. Considering the communication plan between team members, we identified the following points. Every week, our team will conduct meeting with the project manager, where such moments as project status updates and milestone review will be discussed. Also our project manager will send monthly update reports during the development of the thesis, the development team will meet daily in online meetings where they will be able to discuss various details of the project. Actually this stage provides the overview on significant timeframes and identifies deliverables of the project. By scheduling each process of development on milestones we can figure out the full status of our diploma work.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white-50">
                            Eventually our team can start with project execution, since all important aspects regarding of our diploma work were already arranged by timeframes and milestones. In the last stage of project management, we consider the cost, quality, change, procurement and resource management. As it was mentioned before our project was proposed by our university as diploma work. Therefore, there is no any benefits in term of cost. However, due to the sponsorship from our university staff, we can gather sufficient resource such as hosting and data about timetables. Overall our project should satisfy several requirements in order to become quality application which will used in the future. Thus our project should optimize key aspects of timetable management and be convenient and user-friendly. At the time several finished tasks were written in the reports during all wok processes. Since the development of the new system of timetables distribution is not finished yet and still under processing the rest of the deliverables will be available by end of timeframes. Regarding of status of documentation signing, all processes about that topic was already finished and processed. The timeframes of submitting and signing required documentation was successfully fulfilled. By the end of work all general processes of both development and writing documentations were already discussed in advance. Thus, by using several templates for reports we can be sure that all topics was covered successfully and gathered experience from analyzing and writing documentation was received. In order to complete all workload qualitatively necessary requirements were fulfilled. However, there is no top for skills development in project management. Although by finishing project work provide for each team members important experience.</p>
